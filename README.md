# Question: How do you implement a 2D matrix search algorithm with optimal time complexity? C# Summary

The provided C# console application implements a 2D matrix search algorithm with optimal time complexity. The algorithm is designed to work with a matrix that is sorted both row-wise and column-wise. The program begins by initializing a 2D matrix and then prompts the user to input a number to search for within the matrix. The `SearchMatrix` function is then invoked, taking the matrix and the user's target number as parameters. This function initiates its search from the top right corner of the matrix, moving either downwards or to the left depending on whether the current element is smaller or larger than the target number. If the target number is found within the matrix, the function returns true; if the target number is not found, the function returns false. The result of the search is then displayed to the user via the console.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution is quite similar to the C# version in terms of the logic used to solve the problem. Both versions use a similar approach to search the 2D matrix, starting from the top right corner and moving either down or left depending on whether the current element is less than or greater than the target.

However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax of Python and C#:

1. Array Declaration: In C#, a 2D array is declared using commas inside the square brackets (e.g., `int[,] matrix`). In Python, a 2D list (which serves as an equivalent to a 2D array in C#) is declared as a list of lists (e.g., `matrix = [[1, 4, 7, 11, 15], [2, 5, 8, 12, 19], ...]`).

2. Getting Array Dimensions: In C#, the number of rows and columns in the matrix are obtained using the `GetLength` method (e.g., `matrix.GetLength(0)` for rows and `matrix.GetLength(1)` for columns). In Python, the number of rows is obtained using the `len` function on the matrix, and the number of columns is obtained by calling `len` on the first row of the matrix (e.g., `len(matrix)` for rows and `len(matrix[0])` for columns).

3. User Input: In C#, user input is obtained using `Console.ReadLine()` and then converted to an integer using `Convert.ToInt32()`. In Python, user input is obtained using the `input()` function and converted to an integer using `int()`.

4. Main Function: In C#, the main function is defined as `static void Main(string[] args)`. In Python, the main function is usually defined as a normal function (e.g., `def main():`) and then called in a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to ensure that it runs when the script is executed directly, but not when the script is imported as a module.

5. Print Statements: In C#, output is printed to the console using `Console.WriteLine()`. In Python, output is printed using the `print()` function.

# Java Differences

The Java version and the C# version of the 2D matrix search algorithm are very similar in terms of logic and structure. Both versions use a similar approach to solve the problem: they start from the top right corner of the matrix and move either down or left depending on whether the current element is less than or greater than the target. If the target is found, they return true; otherwise, they return false.

However, there are some differences in terms of language features and methods used:

1. Input: In the C# version, the matrix is hardcoded and the target is read from the console using `Console.ReadLine()`. In the Java version, the number of rows and columns, the matrix elements, and the target are all read from the console using a `Scanner` object.

2. Matrix Declaration: In C#, the matrix is declared as a 2D array using the `int[,]` syntax. In Java, the matrix is declared as a 2D array using the `int[][]` syntax.

3. Getting Matrix Dimensions: In C#, the number of rows and columns in the matrix are obtained using the `GetLength` method. In Java, the number of rows is obtained using the `length` property of the matrix, and the number of columns is obtained using the `length` property of the first row of the matrix.

4. Null/Empty Matrix Check: The Java version includes a check to see if the matrix is null or empty before proceeding with the search. The C# version does not include this check.

5. Console Output: In C#, the output is printed to the console using `Console.WriteLine()`. In Java, the output is printed to the console using `System.out.println()`.
